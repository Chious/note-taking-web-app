### Double Editor Issue

**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Component**: `src/components/editor.tsx`, `src/components/note-editor.tsx`  
**Description**: When creating a new note or switching between notes, two Editor.js instances are rendered simultaneously, causing visual duplication and potential functionality issues.

**Symptoms**:

- Two editor instances visible in the DOM
- Both editors have the same `codex-editor` class structure
- Issue occurs when switching from existing note to new note creation
- Issue persists even after page refresh (F5)

**Root Cause Analysis**:

- React Strict Mode causing double mounting in development
- Editor component not properly cleaning up previous instances
- Race conditions in editor initialization
- Missing proper key prop or instance management

**Attempted Fixes**:

1. ‚úÖ Added key prop to force re-mounting: `key={note?.id || 'new-note'}`
2. ‚úÖ Enhanced editor instance detection
3. ‚úÖ Improved cleanup with proper destroy calls
4. ‚úÖ Added debug logging for troubleshooting
5. ‚ùå All fixes reverted by user - issue persists

**Next Steps**:

- [ ] Investigate Editor.js lifecycle management more deeply
- [ ] Consider using a different approach for editor instance management
- [ ] Test with React Strict Mode disabled to isolate the issue
- [ ] Consider using a ref-based approach instead of useEffect
- [ ] Look into Editor.js specific initialization patterns

- Editor.js latest version
- Next.js 14
- Development environment
