# Documentation Structure Rule

## Rule: Minimal Core Documentation Only

### Description

The `/docs` directory must contain only **4 essential files** that cover all project needs. No additional documentation files should be created unless they directly replace one of these core files.

### Required Files (Exactly 4)

1. **`API_DOCUMENTATION.md`** - Centralized API documentation

   - Tech stack overview
   - Database schemas
   - API endpoints and specifications
   - Authentication details
   - OpenAPI configuration
   - All API-related information in one place

2. **`ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup guide

   - Local development setup
   - Production deployment
   - Environment variables
   - Prerequisites and requirements
   - Step-by-step instructions for new developers
   - **THIRD_PARTY integrations** (Cloudflare D1, Workers, etc.)

3. **`ROUTING_AND_STATE_MANAGEMENT.md`** - Frontend architecture

   - Route structure and navigation
   - State management patterns
   - Component organization
   - Frontend configuration

4. **`THIRD_PARTY.md`** - External dependencies and integrations
   - Cloudflare services (D1, Workers, Pages)
   - External libraries and frameworks
   - API integrations and configurations
   - Third-party service setup and management

### Prohibited Actions

- ❌ Creating additional `.md` files in `/docs`
- ❌ Creating subdirectories in `/docs`
- ❌ Creating documentation files outside `/docs` (except README.md)
- ❌ Creating separate files for specific features or components
- ❌ Creating migration logs, security guides, or deployment summaries
- ❌ Creating documentation indexes or overview files

### Required Actions

- ✅ All API information goes in `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- ✅ All setup information goes in `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`
- ✅ All frontend architecture goes in `ROUTING_AND_STATE_MANAGEMENT.md`
- ✅ Update existing files instead of creating new ones
- ✅ Keep files comprehensive but organized
- ✅ Use clear sections and navigation within each file

### File Consolidation Strategy

When adding new information:

1. **API-related**: Add to `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
   - Endpoints, schemas, authentication, tech stack
2. **Setup/Deployment**: Add to `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`
   - Environment setup, deployment process
   - Prerequisites and requirements
3. **Frontend/UI**: Add to `ROUTING_AND_STATE_MANAGEMENT.md`
   - Routes, components, state management patterns
4. **External Dependencies**: Add to `THIRD_PARTY.md`
   - Cloudflare services, external libraries
   - API integrations, third-party configurations

### Examples of What NOT to Create

- `API_DOCS_SECURITY.md` → Merge into `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` → Merge into `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`
- `AUTH_SETUP.md` → Merge into `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- `TESTING.md` → Merge into `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`
- `README.md` in `/docs` → Not needed, use project root README.md

### Benefits

- **Simplicity**: Developers know exactly where to find information
- **Maintainability**: Fewer files to keep updated
- **Completeness**: Each file is comprehensive in its domain
- **Efficiency**: No time wasted searching multiple files
